A drone captures waves crashing against rugged cliffs along Big Surâ€™s Garay Point Beach. Blue waters create white-tipped waves, illuminated by the golden sunset. A distant island with a lighthouse adds to the view, while green shrubbery lines the cliffs. The dramatic drop from the road to the beach showcases the raw beauty of the Pacific Coast.
A snowy landscape where a skier carves through fresh powder, their breath visible in the crisp air. The towering pine trees are laden with snow, and the sky above is clear and bright, dotted with wisps of clouds.
A misty rainforest with a rock climber ascending a waterfall-covered cliff. The air is thick with humidity, and the lush green foliage around them seems alive with movement, while monkeys swing between the branches above.
